# TheLeftOrRightGame

## Installation

Clone the repo, install the packages under the `/client` and `/server` folders.
You might need to contact me so I can send you some environment variables in order to make it work.
After installing, run `node server` on the `/server` and `npm run dev` on the `/client`.
The server should run at `http://localhost:3001` and the client code is aware of it.

## How to play

The Left or Right game is a simple, elegantly designed game!

1. Register your name.
2. Read the instructions carefully.
3. Press "l" to move right, "a" to move left.
4. If you want to know who is the undefeated champ you can go to `http://localhost:3001/leaderboard`.

Let's play!
